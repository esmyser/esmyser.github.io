<div class="entry-content"><p>OR WHY I DECIDED TO LEARN TO SPEAK COMPUTER</p>

<p>About two months ago I was accepted into Flatiron and my Grandma treated me to dinner to celebrate. As we waited for our appetizers, she, being a good Jewish grandmother, was grilling me about my life. “Do you still live in Chinatown?” “Why didn’t you become a doctor? Or a lawyer like your brother.” “You know your brother calls me every week.”</p>

<p>Just kidding — she isn’t actually like that. Though she can guilt trip with the best of them, this was a time to celebrate. She was curious why I was going back to school and what I was going to learn. For an 85 year old, she’s a tech whiz. She has an iPad, she surfs the internet, she sends me emails and texts, but it’s all magic. As it is for almost everyone. It’s great that it exists, but who knows how it works.</p>

<p>“I’m going to learn to code.”</p>

<p>“But what is that? What’s code?”</p>

<p>I looked down my nose:</p>

<p>“You know how God said ‘let there be light’ and there was light? It’s like that.”</p>

<pre><code>
class Light

  def initialize
    speed = 299792458 #m/s
    wave = true
    particle = true
  end
…
</code></pre>


<p>Sacrilege! Heresy! Of course, I was joking. Coding does not a god make, nor is it a holy endeavor, and I don’t think we live in the Matrix (though apparently some people think there’s a good chance <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2013/dec/09-do-we-live-in-the-matrix#.UoYKjHBFB17">we do</a>). But the metaphor works: coding is creation through words. There’s something really, really awesome about that. You can state anything and in the world of your program it is true. It becomes fact. Rarely in life do we have such control over the things around us. In Ruby, it seems like you can do anything. You can even redefine the basic laws of the universe. Does 2 + 2 = 5? Hell yeah it does, in the world of my weird little Ruby program.</p>

<pre><code>
class Fixnum
  alias_method :old_add, :+
  def +(num)
    self.old_add(num) + 1
  end
end
</code></pre>




<pre><code>
2 + 2 == 5 
=> true
</code></pre>


<p>(My friend <a href="http://gosborn.github.io/">Greg</a> actually did this and apparently it will blow up your IRB. So be careful out there.)</p>

<p>Code is language. Language is the most robust and explicit way humans pass information. Spoken language allows us to communicate knowledge directly. Written language allows us to do the same over relatively vast distances and time. Now digital languages allow us to build with the words themselves. If you want to really stretch this idea (and stake out a fairly strong metaphysical claim), information is the basic building block of the universe, and we recently discovered a new kind of hammer.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Code is just strings. Everything’s a string. It’s called string theory.”</p></blockquote>

<p>-Avi, our teacher, with the Flatiron equivalent of a dad joke</p>

<p>Using code we can take a word, a string, and turn it into anything. We can make it a number, a container, a whole set of logical and mathematical processes. We can twist it and turn it and change it into whatever we want. Code is the language of creation, and ultimately that’s what I wanted to convey to my Grandma. I’m learning to code because I want to create. I want to build. At six weeks into Flatiron, we just started to work with Rails. We’re finally making full applications. I can’t wait to see what we’ll all build in the next six weeks.</p>
